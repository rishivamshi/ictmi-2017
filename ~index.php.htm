             International Conference on "International Conference on Translational Medicine and Imaging" (ICTMI) will be an annual event for world leading scientists, engineers and clinicians from a wide range of disciplines associated with computer assisted medical imaging. The ICTMI Conferences will be rotated among the Asian Subcontinent. Bio imaging has continued to evolve across a wide spectrum of applications from diagnostics to personalized therapy to mechanistic understanding of biological processes. The field continues to be challenged with ever increasing demand on more robust methods and integration with clinical and molecular data. The conference series includes two days of oral presentations and poster sessions along with a preconference worshop. It also includes workshops, tutorials and challenges related to the field of medical imaging. The associated satellite events focus in detail on current status and advances in the topics of ICTMI. It is a great opportunity for the world biomedical engineering & medical community to host this conference in India for the first time. We are proud to promote and foster the exchange and dissemination of advanced knowledge, expertise and experience in the medical imaging field contributed by outstanding scientists from leading institutions, physicians and educators around the world.
